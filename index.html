    <h2><right>I need help developing a bot, what do I do?</right></h2>
    <br>
    <p>If you need help developing a bot (website, API, application, or anything on this planet) join our discord server (/links). Search the "I-need-help" channel,
       and just ask your question there. (Due discord-server settings you need to wait 5 minutes until sending your first message.) But not just developing, if you need 
       help in game's,  real-life-decisions, or anything else, you can ask our community
    </p>
